## vue-cli with SASS compilation

This repository demonstrates how to set up a Vue.js project using Vue CLI 3 with SCSS (Sass) support. SCSS is a powerful CSS preprocessor that allows for variables, nesting, mixins, and more, making your stylesheets more maintainable and scalable. Vue CLI 3 provides a modern development environment with features like hot module replacement, code splitting, and an extensible plugin system.
